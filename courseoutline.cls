%
% The 'courseoutline' class generates course outlines as required at
% Memorial University of Newfoundland.  Many of its settings default to
% values appropriate for the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science,
% but should be customisable for other faculties and departments via LaTeX
% class options.
%
% The class assumes that you have installed the commercial Adobe Garamond Pro
% files (licensed by the University) and are running under XeLaTeX.
%
% The class currently supports two options:
%
%   - engineering:  Use the names "Engineering", "Faculty of Engineering", etc.
%                   in the relevant places and emit the Faculty's policy on
%                   academic integrity ("Like Professional Engineers...").
%   - ece:          Use the names "Electrical and Computer Engineering", etc.
%                   in the relevant places and emit the Engineering policy on
%                   academic integrity ("Like Professional Engineers...").
%   - safelabs:     Don't emit a "Lab Safety" section even if a lab slot is
%                   declared with \lab. This is intended for use with
%                   computer labs (not electrical, structural, chemical labs).
%
% The following commands must be used to declare key information about the
% course (illustrated with example or default inputs):
%
% \coursename{Foundations of programming}
% \coursenumber{3891}
% \courseterm{Fall 2014}
%
% \instructor{Your name}
% \email{your.email@provider.com}
% \phone{(123) 456-7890 x9876}
% \office{EN1234}
% \officehours{Tue 15:00--16:00, Thu 09:00--10:00}
%
%
% The following commands are optional:
%
% \ta{The name(s) of TA(s), if any}
% \tamail{\{ta1,ta2\}@provider.com}
% \taphone{(123) 456-7890 x1234}
% \taoffice{EN4321}
% \tahours{Thu}{15:00}{16:00}
%
% \website{http://faculty.uni.com/course_website}      % no need for \url{}!
% \communication{other ways to communicate}
% \officialdescription{description from official (accreditation?) documents}
%
% \prerequisites{ENGI1020,MATH1000}
%
% \lecture{MWF}{9:00}{10:00}{EN2006}
% \tutorial{Tue}{14:00}{15:00}{EN2006}
% \lab{Thu}{14:00}{17:00}{EN3099}
%
%
% Based on this input, the class exports the following commands:
%
% \nameandnumber       % e.g., "Engineering 1000"
% \shortnumber         % e.g., "ENGI 1000"
% \shortname           % e.g., "Introduction to Stuff"
% \fullname            % e.g., "Engineering 1000: Introduction to Stuff"

\section{Academic Integrity and Professional Conduct}

Students are expected to conduct themselves in all aspects of the course at the
highest level of academic integrity.
Any student found to commit academic misconduct will be dealt with according
to the Faculty and University practices.
More information is available at
\url{http://www.mun.ca/engineering/undergrad/academicintegrity.php}.

Students are encouraged to consult the Faculty of Engineering and Applied
Science Student Code of Conduct at
\url{http://www.mun.ca/engineering/undergrad/academicintegrity.php}
and Memorial University's Code of Student Conduct at
\url{http://www.mun.ca/student/conduct}.

\else
\section{Academic Integrity}
Students are reminded of the Memorial University of Newfoundland Code,
which states:

\begin{quote}
All members of the Memorial University of Newfoundland Community, which includes
students, faculty, and staff, shall treat others with respect and fairness, be
responsible and honest, and uphold the highest standards of academic integrity.
\end{quote}

Academic misconduct is governed by section 6.11 of the University Calendar,
which begins:

\begin{quote}
Within the University community there is a collective responsibility to maintain
a high level of scholarly integrity. A student is expected to adhere to those
principles which constitute proper academic conduct. Academic misconduct cannot
be condoned or even appear to be condoned. A student has the responsibility to
know which actions, as described under Academic Offences, could be construed as
dishonest or improper. A student is reminded that for further guidance on proper
scholarly behaviour he/she should seek advice from his/her instructors and
faculty advisors.
\end{quote}

\if@si
\section{Supplemental Instruction}

Supplemental Instruction (SI) is a peer-facilitated learning enhancement model
designed to improve student learning and performance in difficult courses.
During SI sessions, the SI Leader engages students using interactive learning
strategies, which encourage involvement, comprehension, and synthesis of
subject content.

SI is attached to this course to provide a systematic and structured approach
for processing the course material.
Two SI sessions will be offered weekly.
The schedule will be announced in the first week of classes.

% The 'safelabs' option was passed to the class, elide the Lab Safety statement.

\ifdefined\@labtimes
\section{Lab Safety}
Students are expected to demonstrate awareness
of, and personal accountability for, safe laboratory conduct. Appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE) must be worn (e.g. steel-toed shoes,
safety glasses, etc.) and safe work practices must be followed as indicated
for individual laboratories, materials and equipment. Students will
immediately report any concerns regarding safety to the teaching assistant,
staff technologist, and professor.
\fi
\fi


\section{Inclusion and Equity}

Students who require accommodations are encouraged to contact the Glenn Roy
Blundon Centre, \url{http://www.mun.ca/blundon/about/index.php}.
The mission of the Blundon Centre is to provide and co-ordinate programs and
services that enable students with disabilities to maximize their educational
potential and to increase awareness of inclusive values among all members of the
university community.

The university experience is enriched by the diversity of viewpoints, values,
and backgrounds that each class participant possesses.
In order for this course to encourage as much insightful and comprehensive
discussion among class participants as possible, there is an expectation that
dialogue will be collegial and respectful across disciplinary, cultural, and
personal boundaries.


\section{Student Assistance}
Student Affairs and Services offers help
and support in a variety of areas, both academic and personal. More
information can be found at \url{http://www.mun.ca/student}.
